# SafePath-Bangladesh
SafePath Bangladesh is a youth-led digital platform for promoting safer roads. It allows citizens to report unsafe vehicles or accident-prone areas, view high-risk zones on an interactive map, and build public accountability in transportation through real-time reporting and community data sharing.
